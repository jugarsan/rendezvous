# Given an array of 0s and 1s that represent a garden, where 0 is a plot that hasnâ€™t been planted on,
# and 1 is a plot that has been planted on, return true if n plants can be planted without touching another plant.
#
# Example:
#
# garden = [1,0,0,0,1]
#
# $ canPlant(garden, 1)
# $ true // plant at position 2
# $ canPlant(garden, 4)
# $ false // there are only 3 plots, and two of them can't be planted on
